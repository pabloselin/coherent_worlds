===========================================

[GN]
There are no visible exits

You fall asleep ...

[GN]
You wake up in the same small, clean room.
There is someone staring at you.
He opens his mouth to talk.

:FX:Crackling or distortion

You fall asleep again ...

[GN]

You are in an open place now.
You see some columns, the remains of an old building from a long forgotten civilization.
You stare at the columns closely.

:FX:Same crackling or distortion

You can see the marble of the columns falling apart.
A small, discrete noise invades you.

:FX:Some melodic stuff progressively fades in

There is a huge number 2 in front of you.
The number 2 turns into a circle
The circle starts to sing

[MCH]
HALLLOOO

OUR MENTAL FECES INVADE YOUR BODYYYY
WE NEED TO MAKE YrUMM FOR OYR CHILDRENNN

[GN]
You can feel your own heartbeat.
You now notice that you were sleeping.
But you can't move yet.
This is what they call the 
-lucid sleep paralysis-,
it'll pass don't be afraid.
The person you saw before is still staring at you.
He is talking now and you can understand something.

[DJ]
Something ... something ...

[DJ]

armpits ... no turn back ... presocratic knowledge ... wake up

[MCH]

:FS:

YOU v/s DARK JHON
// this is a made up fight that we can use to show the game mechanics,
// it can be totally scripted and is best that you always lose.

[DJ]
Now that i finally have your attention let me tell you this.
We sing to everyone the same song.
It is called: 

The calypso ragtime infection.
==============================
:FX:The same melodic stuff that you barely heard before

[GN]
Dark Jhon starts singing...

Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die? Will you die? Will you die?

You want to make the world coherent.
But nothing makes sense in the beginning.

Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die? Will you die? Will you die?

Are they really a dream?
Are your choral voices a fantasy?

Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die? Will you die? Will you die?

And this is the way your life started.
I don't know if you had a previous story.
But let me tell you that our world is collapsed.
And everywhere you look an infection takes place.

Mysterious computers appear out of nowhere.

Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die?
Will you die? Will you die? Will you die? Will you die?

TITLE SCREEN

=Coherent Worlds=
=Chapter 1: What the FUCK is happening here?=

[GN]
You are alone now.
Your brain seems fully recovered.
You can also move.
And there's an open door in front of you!

[OPT]
Leave the room?

[N]
You are still alone.
You feel ok.
Maybe you should try to find some answers...

[OPT]
Leave the room now?

[N]
The door closes automatically...
You can't leave now.
You feel that you missed your chance to learn something.
The door opens again!

[OPT]
Exit the room this time? (Hint: YES)

[N]
Someone kills you, you become crazy, you can't decide anything anymore.
GAME OVER.

NOTE: For gameovers, please respawn in the last option...

[Y]
After walking through a passage you arrive to a huge hall.
There are at least 10 floors and 10 different platforms connected by escalators.
Dark John is waiting for you in the center of the hall.

*******************************************************************

[OPTION]

NOTE: We can put here the different places that you can go.
It can be a fractal structure so you can go to 4 places from here
and then 4 places more and so.

We can limit the places and also figure out a map to show you where you are, 
the idea is that you get an initial sense of freedom and variety triggered
by some randomizations of the story unfolding.

You can find one of three characters:

The dog-head
The dog-human-hands
The she-squid

Also, Dark Jhon is in the main hall and can answer your questions in a less cryptic way.
He is also useful to check your stats.

He has some questionnaires that change depending in what chapter or level of progress are you in.
When you end the questionnaire, some texts appear to condense all the meaning.
